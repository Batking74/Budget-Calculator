# Budget-Calculator

This is a Budget Calculator Application that will help you manage your net income and expenses.
I wanted to build something that would help me manage, and setaside/save for things easily.


## How it works
  1. The user must have a Net Income.
  2. Choose where you want to setaside money to, and choose if you want to setaside a percentage or fixed amount (you can add a setAside if needed).
  3. Click the calculate button, then you will see the results output where it says "Results".
  4. Your new net pay aka "Spending Money" will get lower the more setasides you put towards.


## This Project does the following
  - Takes away a percentage or fixed number specified by the user for setasides.
  - Calculates the new net pay/spending money by deducting user specified amount.
  - Has the option to add as many set asides as needed.
  - Has the option to clear all inputs.
